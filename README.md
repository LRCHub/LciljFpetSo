[00:13.44] Oh, what you do to me is honestly breaking my heart
[00:19.22] It's so frequently, recently, it's been so hard to find
[00:25.42] Remedies, enemies, what in the hell could I do?
[00:34.58] We were just passing by, maybe I shouldn't feel hopeless for losing time
[00:42.27] Realize you speak out of focus, I'm done with crying every night
[00:49.04] I did the most I could do
[01:01.54] 
[00:56.46] 'Cause I wrote you a letter with ink and a feather
[01:02.15] It won't matter how far you are
[01:06.24] But in the end, it's not written
[01:10.10] I caught myself thinking 'bout you
[01:27.10] 
[01:23.67] No, no
[01:28.11] Oh-oh
[01:30.61] 
[01:33.27] Oh, won't you show me love, just enough
[01:37.03] To keep me praying for more to come?
[01:41.08] It's the last I saw the signs from a mile away
[01:46.11] Could you hear me say that I miss you dearly?
[01:52.74] No, won't you know, whenever things go bad, I rely on you?
[02:03.62] And I try not to hold it all inside
[02:08.11] In a moment, you'll take all my pride, oh yeah, yeah
[02:34.11] 
[02:16.66] 'Cause I wrote you a letter with ink and a feather
[02:22.47] It won't matter how far you are
[02:26.65] But in the end, it's not real
[02:30.31] I caught myself thinking 'bout you
[02:47.31] 
[02:35.07] Anywhere I go, I'll find my own road
[02:40.02] And put my feelings aside in my mind
[02:45.49] Every night you got me thinking
[02:50.33] Baby, it's hard to be, I don't know
[02:54.72] I let you think it
[03:03.72] 
[02:57.17] So maybe I shouldn't crumble the letter
[03:02.49] So you'll read it better
[03:05.20] I hate how you're not in my car
[03:09.11] So in the end, it's all written
[03:12.92] I caught myself thinking 'bout you
